Hi! My name is Diego Calbucheo, 
a Master's student of Applied Ecology of Universidad Austral de Chile who is currently working on mapping green urban areas within cities of Chile.
My personal/academic interests include ecosystem services, ecological restoration in productive/antropogenic systems, green corridors, among others.

I'm in Github because I'm looking for tutorials/communities  about data sciences, mapping and GIS tools.
